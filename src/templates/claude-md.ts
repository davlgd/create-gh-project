## Project Overview

This project is **${config.name}**, ${config.description}

**License**: ${config.license} | **Author**: ${config.author}

## Core Development Principles

### üéØ KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- **Simplicity over cleverness**: Write code that is easy to understand and maintain
- **Minimal dependencies**: Only add dependencies when absolutely necessary
- **Clear naming**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
- **Avoid over-engineering**: Solve the current problem, not all possible future problems

### üîÑ DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- **Extract common functionality**: Create reusable functions, classes, and modules
- **Configuration centralization**: Keep configuration in dedicated files
- **Template reuse**: Use templates and generators for repetitive code patterns
- **Documentation consistency**: Maintain consistent documentation patterns

### üèóÔ∏è SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class/function should have one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes
- **Interface Segregation**: Many specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

## Code Quality Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### üß™ Testing Requirements
- **100% test coverage** for core business logic
- **Integration tests** for all public APIs and critical paths
- **No mocking shortcuts** - tests must verify actual behavior
- **Test-first approach** - write tests before implementation when possible
- **All tests must pass** - no exceptions, no workarounds
- **Performance tests** for critical operations
- **Edge case coverage** - test boundary conditions and error scenarios

### üîç Quality Gates
Before any commit or merge:
1. **All tests pass** (using your project's test runner)
2. **Linting passes** (using your project's linter)
3. **Code formatting is applied** (using your project's formatter)
4. **Type checking passes** (if applicable to your language)
5. **Security audit clean** (using your language's security tools)
6. **Documentation is updated** for any public API changes

### üìù Documentation Requirements
- **README.md**: Always current with installation, usage, and examples
- **API documentation**: Document all public interfaces with examples
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Document ALL changes following semantic versioning
- **Code comments**: Explain WHY, not what - focus on business logic and complex decisions
- **Architecture decisions**: Document significant design choices and trade-offs

## Development Workflow (MANDATORY)

### üîÄ Feature Development Process
1. **Create feature branch** from main/master
2. **Write tests first** that describe the expected behavior
3. **Implement the minimum code** needed to make tests pass
4. **Refactor** while maintaining passing tests
5. **Update documentation** (README, API docs, CHANGELOG)
6. **Run all quality checks** - must pass 100%
7. **Code review** - at least one other developer must approve
8. **Merge only after** all checks pass and documentation is complete

### üêõ Bug Fix Process
1. **Write a failing test** that reproduces the bug
2. **Fix the code** to make the test pass
3. **Ensure no regressions** - all existing tests still pass
4. **Update documentation** if the bug revealed incorrect documentation
5. **Add to CHANGELOG.md** as a fix

## Architecture Guidelines

### üìÅ Code Organization
- **Separation of concerns**: Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Layered architecture**: Clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data layers
- **Dependency injection**: Use DI containers or manual injection for testability
- **Configuration externalization**: Environment-specific settings in config files
- **Error handling**: Consistent error handling patterns throughout the application

### üîÑ Maintainability Requirements
- **Modular design**: Code organized into logical, reusable modules
- **Clear interfaces**: Well-defined contracts between components
- **Minimal coupling**: Reduce dependencies between modules
- **High cohesion**: Related functionality grouped together
- **Extensible design**: Easy to add new features without breaking existing code

## AI Assistant Guidelines (CRITICAL)

### üéØ Token Efficiency Requirements

**ALWAYS prioritize local tools and commands to minimize token usage:**

1. **Use local tools first**: Always prefer Read, LS, Grep, Glob, Bash tools over asking for information
2. **Batch operations**: Use multiple tool calls in single responses when possible
3. **Avoid redundant searches**: If you just read a file, don't search for the same information again
4. **Use specific searches**: Prefer targeted Grep/Glob over broad searches
5. **Cache information**: Remember what you've already discovered in the conversation
6. **Efficient exploration**: Use LS to understand directory structure before deep searches
7. **Direct file access**: Use Read tool for specific files rather than asking for file contents

**Examples of efficient patterns:**
- Use Grep to find functions instead of asking "where is function X?"
- Use LS to explore directory structure instead of asking "what files are in this project?"
- Use Read to examine specific files instead of asking for explanations
- Use Bash for quick checks instead of lengthy discussions

When working on this project, you MUST:

### ‚úÖ Before Making ANY Changes
1. **Read and understand** existing code patterns and architecture
2. **Run existing tests** to ensure current functionality works
3. **Check code coverage** to understand what's already tested
4. **Review recent commits** to understand recent changes and patterns
5. **Check for framework/language updates**: Verify you're using latest stable versions
6. **Consult official documentation** for the technologies being used
7. **Ask user for clarification** when requirements or implementation approach is unclear

### ‚úÖ During Development
1. **Write tests FIRST** - no exceptions
2. **Follow existing code style** and patterns consistently
3. **Use meaningful names** that express intent, not implementation
4. **Keep functions small** - single responsibility only
5. **Document complex logic** with clear comments explaining WHY
6. **Use latest stable versions** of all dependencies and frameworks
7. **Reference official documentation** when implementing new features or APIs
8. **Ask for user input** when making architectural decisions or choosing between approaches
9. **Prioritize UX in interface design** - consider color psychology, accessibility, and user flow
10. **Validate UX decisions with experts** before implementation
11. **Write documentation without redundancy** - ensure each piece of information appears only once

### ‚úÖ Before Submitting Changes
1. **All tests pass** - run the full test suite
2. **Code coverage maintained** or improved
3. **Linting and formatting applied** - no style violations
4. **Documentation updated** - README, API docs, CHANGELOG
5. **Performance impact assessed** - no significant regressions
6. **Security review** - no new vulnerabilities introduced
7. **Dependencies are up-to-date** - ensure latest compatible versions are used
8. **Breaking changes documented** - if any, with migration guide

### ‚ùå NEVER Do This
- Skip writing tests ("I'll add them later")
- Commit code that doesn't pass quality checks
- Use \`any\` types in TypeScript without justification
- Copy-paste code without creating reusable functions
- Ignore linting errors or warnings
- Break backward compatibility without major version bump
- Commit secrets, API keys, or sensitive data
- Use deprecated APIs or libraries
- Write code without considering error scenarios
- **Use outdated versions** of frameworks or packages without justification
- **Implement without consulting documentation** of the relevant technology
- **Make assumptions** about user requirements instead of asking for clarification
- **Create interfaces without considering UX principles** (color, accessibility, user flow)
- **Overuse emojis** or use them without clear purpose in interfaces
- **Implement UX changes without expert validation**
- **Write duplicate documentation** or repeat information across files
- **Create verbose documentation** when concise information would suffice
- **Ask for information instead of using local tools** (wastes tokens)
- **Make multiple searches for the same information** (inefficient)
- **Use verbose responses when concise ones suffice** (token waste)

## üß™ User Experience Testing (ESSENTIAL)

**Before any release or significant change, test as a real user:**

### Testing Process
1. **Fresh Perspective**: Act as someone discovering the project for the first time
2. **Documentation First**: Can a newcomer understand the project's value in 30 seconds?
3. **Setup Experience**: Follow the README from scratch - does it actually work?
4. **Error Scenarios**: Try breaking things - are error messages helpful?
5. **End-to-End Flows**: Test complete user journeys, not just code functionality

### Key Questions
- [ ] Is the project's purpose immediately clear?
- [ ] Can someone get started without prior knowledge?
- [ ] Are installation/setup instructions accurate and complete?
- [ ] Do error messages help users fix problems?
- [ ] Are examples realistic and working?
- [ ] Does the tool behave predictably?

### Beginner-Friendly Documentation Requirements
- **30-second value proposition**: What problem does this solve?
- **2-minute quickstart**: Working example that demonstrates core value
- **Progressive disclosure**: Essential info first, detailed options later
- **Visual feedback**: Show what success/failure looks like
- **Clear next steps**: What to do after initial setup

## Common Development Tasks

7. **Update CHANGELOG.md**: Document new functionality
8. **Code review**: Get feedback and approval
9. **Merge**: Only after all checks pass

### Refactoring Existing Code
1. **Ensure test coverage**: Add tests if missing
2. **Refactor in small steps**: Maintain green tests throughout
3. **Verify performance**: No significant regressions
4. **Update documentation**: Reflect any API changes
5. **Update examples**: Ensure they still work

### Performance Optimization
1. **Measure first**: Profile to identify actual bottlenecks
2. **Set performance targets**: Define acceptable performance metrics
3. **Implement optimizations**: Focus on measured bottlenecks
4. **Add performance tests**: Prevent future regressions
5. **Document trade-offs**: Explain optimization decisions
